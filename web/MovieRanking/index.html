    <h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>The Passion of the Christ</h3>
    <p>It, within the artistic relm of freedom, accurately shows the suffing and humilation of Christ on the cross</p>

    <h3>40 Year-Old Virgin</h3>
    <p>Only comedy that I watched that lasted the test of time</p>

    <h3>Thor: Ragnarok</h3>
    <p>I love everything that director Taika Waititi is involved with.</p>
